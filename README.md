## 💡 Philosophy & What Drives Me

> “Make code simple, reliable, and maintainable.”  

I believe clean code is more than just working — it’s about readability, future-proofing and respect for fellow developers.  
I enjoy digging into tasks: from small utilities and CLI tools to larger integrations and backend services.  
I’m always open to collaboration, code reviews and learning new technologies.
